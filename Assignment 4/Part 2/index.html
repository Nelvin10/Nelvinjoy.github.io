This JavaScript code improves a webpage's image gallery capability. Images and alt text are dynamically loaded from an array of image filenames. Thumbnail images are created and added to the thumbBar element.
 Additionally, it configures event listeners to update the displayed image and its alt text in response to the click of a thumbnail image. It also includes a Darken/Lighten option that allows you to adjust
  the overlay's background colour to make the displayed image appear dimmer.
